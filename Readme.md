# About Project

Healthcare Supply Chain is a complex network of several independent entities that include raw material suppliers, manufacturers, distributor, pharmacies, hospitals and patients. 

Tracking supplies through this network is non-trivial due to several factors including lack of information, centralized control and competing behaviour among stakeholders.
